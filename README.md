# Bash
1. Check if you have a `.bashrc` file in your home directory. Open the terminal and type `ls ~/.bashrc`. If you receive a warning saying no such file or directory exists, type `touch ~/.bashrc`. This creates an empty file for us.

1. Check if you have a `.bash_profile` in your home directory. Open the terminal and type `ls ~/.bash_profile`. If you receive a warning saying no such file or directory exists, type `touch ~/.bash_profile`.

1. Execute the follow commands at the terminal.
  ```
  echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```
  ```
  echo 'test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```

1. Check `.bash_profile` to make sure it has the contents we expect. Type `cat ~/.bash_profile` in the terminal to look at the contents of the file. Near the bottom, you should have something that looks like this:
  ```
  export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
  test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
  ```

1. Update `/etc/paths` by running the following commands.

  ```
  echo '/\/usr\/local\/bin/\nd\nwq' | sudo ed /etc/paths
  ```
  ```
  echo '1i\n/usr/local/bin\n.\nwq' | sudo ed /etc/paths
  ```

1. Inspect our changes by typing `cat /etc/paths`. It should look like this:

  ```
  /usr/local/bin
  /usr/bin
  /bin
  /usr/sbin
  /sbin
  ```

# APPS

  **NOTE: YOUR SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY THROW SOME ERRORS HERE!** Some of these errors are probably minor, but some might not be; please wait until one of the instructors has given you the go-ahead before moving on.

1. Once Homebrew says `Your system is ready to brew`, run  `brew update` to update Homebrew's directory of packages.

### NVM and Node/NPM
1. Run `brew install nvm` into the terminal.

1. Add the following snippet to your bash configuration file `.bash_profile`.
  ```
  export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
  source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
  ```

1. Use NVM to install the latest stable version of Node:
  ```
  nvm install stable
  ```

1. Use NPM to install important Node modules and make them available across all of our projects:
  ```
  npm install -g jshint grunt-cli bower yo gulp
  ```

1. Install the node version for the AMEX project:
  ```
  nvm install 0.10.26
  ```
  ```
  nvm use 0.10.26

# Bash
1. Check if you have a `.bashrc` file in your home directory. Open your terminal and type `ls ~/.bashrc`. If you receive a warning saying no such file or directory exists, type `touch ~/.bashrc`. This creates an empty file for us.

2. Check if you have a `.bash_profile` in your home directory. Open your terminal and type `ls ~/.bash_profile`. If you receive a warning saying no such file or directory exists, type `touch ~/.bash_profile`.

3. Execute the follow commands at the terminal.
```
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
```
```
echo 'test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

4. Check `.bash_profile` to make sure it has the contents we expect. Type `cat ~/.bash_profile` in the terminal to look at the contents of the file. Near the bottom, you should have something that looks like this:
```
# ~/.bash_profile

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

5. Update `/etc/paths` by running the following commands.

```
echo '/\/usr\/local\/bin/\nd\nwq' | sudo ed /etc/paths
```
```
echo '1i\n/usr/local/bin\n.\nwq' | sudo ed /etc/paths
```

6. Inspect our changes by typing `cat /etc/paths`. It should look like this:

```
# /etc/paths

/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
```
